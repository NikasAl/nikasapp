Looking around and seeing no one, the boy decided to eat a small bun that lay entirely with the edge of the ... As soon as he climbed on a chair and looked up - he was amazed to see that the great giants sit at the other edge of the table. Their eyes were evil, they themselves were hairy, but instead of a nose they had a pig's nostrils. Terrified boy fell from a chair and a potion that the old man wanted to throw the boy spilled past, but still hurt the boy ...  \
